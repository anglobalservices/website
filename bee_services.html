                        set up by the Indian Government under the Ministry of Power pursuant to the provisions of the
                        Energy Conservation Act, 2001 with the primary purpose of saving energy & cost in India. </p>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">The Government of India has made it authoritative for some
                        notified products or items to have star ratings and labels which specify the energy-saving

                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">The mission of BEE or Bureau of Energy Efficiency is to
                        institutionalize energy efficiency programs, promote in-country delivery mechanisms and give
                        energy efficiency leadership in all sectors of the country.</p>

                        The Hon'ble Minister of Power launched a star marking scheme in May 2006 in order to make
                        electrical appliances more energy-efficient. A total of 29 products are safeguarded by this
                        initiative in the province, of which ten are covered by the mandatory framework & 19 by the
                        voluntary scheme.
                        Under the Star Labelling Scheme of the BEE, only the importer, trader, or manufacturer can apply
                        for the license.

                    <h3>Procedure for BEE Registration</h3>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">Step 1: Company Registration:. The process or registration
                        includes the submission of vital documents & information of the applicant. Documents like ISO
                        9001, Certificate of Incorporation (COI), Trademark, etc., are required to be uploaded during
                        online filing. </p>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">Step 2: Testing: Once the Company Registration application is
                        consented to by the Bureau, then the applicant gets login credentials for their portal over the
                        registered email Id. Using the same, the applicant or candidate can fill out the Model
                        Registration Application, but before proceeding with the process of Model Registration, the
                        applicant needs to get their products tested from a NABL accredited lab/from an ILAC MRA lab.
                        The test report should be as per the BEE defined format & must include all the testing
                        parameters. For product testing, the candidate needs to share the testing documents and product
                        sample as specified by the testing facility. Before applying for the Model Registration, it
                        should be cross-checked that the lab reports issue date is not more than 90 days.</p>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">Step 3: Model Registration: Once the testing is completed,
                        the applicant can now apply for Model Registration on the online BEE portal. The BEE
                        Registration needs mandatory documents in a particular format along with the test report.
                        Once the application is submitted, all the hardcopy originals with the online application &
                        payment receipt are submitted to the Department. The Department examines all the submitted
                        documents and provides the final license to the applicant.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Validity and Renewal of BEE Registration Certificate</h3>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">The validity of BEE Registration is three years from the date
                        of Certificate is issued. The BEE Registration Certificate validity can be renewed by paying the
                        fees along with the required documents.</p>
