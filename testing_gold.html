                                                    government will only permit the sale of gold jewellery with a
                                                    Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number. This new regulation
                                                    means that all gold jewellery sold in India must carry a BIS
                                                    hallmark and a six-digit alphanumeric ID embossed on the piece. HUID
                                                    was introduced to ensure transparency and protect consumers' rights,
                                                    as it allows anyone to get existing jewellery hallmarked and obtain
                                                    a true valuation of the gold. The HUID code also allows buyers to
                                                    verify the claims made by jewellers regarding the purity of the gold
                                                    jewellery. It can be verified on the BIS Care App, and if a jeweller
                                                    has stamped a fake HUID code, buyers have a way to verify it and

                                                    credibility to the hallmarking signs on the piece. The BIS has
                                                    launched the BIS Care App, which helps gold jewellery buyers verify

                                                    hallmark mandatory for the sale of gold jewellery and artefacts from
                                                    June 16, 2021. Further, the government has revised the BIS hallmark
                                                    signs on gold jewellery from July 1, 2021. The revised signs on BIS
                                                    hallmarked gold jewellery are as follows: BIS logo Purity/Fineness

                                                    According to the Department of Consumer Affairs, each piece of gold
                                                    jewellery stamped with a HUID code offers a distinct identity to it.

                                                    to the hallmarking signs on the gold jewellery. The BIS has launched
                                                    an app called BIS Care App. This app helps gold jewellery buyers to
                                                    verify the authenticity of the HUID code. If there is a mismatch
                                                    between the information provided on the BIS Care App and the
                                                    information provided by the jeweller, then a buyer can file a
                                                    complaint as well. The Department of Consumer Affairs stated, "HUID

                                                    Unique Identification (HUID) number is a six-digit alphanumeric code
                                                    consisting of numbers and letters. Every unit of jewellery will be
                                                    given a HUID number during the hallmarking process, and it will be
                                                    unique to that piece. The number is stamped on the jewellery piece
                                                    manually at the Assaying & Hallmarking Centre (AHC). The Union

                                                    for businesses in complying with the order, the government will give

                                                    units in the North East. The move is aimed at promoting a quality

                                                    April 1, 2023, if you visit your local jewellery store to buy gold
                                                    jewellery, then ensure that apart from the BIS hallmark, there is a
                                                    6-digit alphanumeric ID embossed in the gold jewellery. For every
                                                    piece of gold jewellery which is hallmarked by the Bureau of Indian
                                                    Standards (BIS), a unique HUID code is given to it. The HUID allows
                                                    buyers to verify the claims made by jewellers regarding the purity
                                                    of the gold jewellery piece. The HUID code stamped on the gold
                                                    jewellery can be used to track the entire journey of the jewellery
                                                    piece from the manufacturer to the retailer. This provides consumers
                                                    with greater transparency and ensures that they are getting what
                                                    they pay for. Additionally, the HUID code also helps in identifying
                                                    counterfeit jewellery, which is a major problem in India. With the
                                                    introduction of the HUID code, consumers can be confident that they
                                                    are buying genuine and authentic gold jewellery. Overall, the
                                                    implementation of the HUID code is a positive development for
                                                    consumers as it provides them with greater transparency and ensures
