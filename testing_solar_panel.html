                                                <p class="p-design m-t20 col-md-12">o test your solar panels, you
                                                    will need to perform a fairly simple calculation. Basically, you
                                                    will need to multiply the volts and amps, as this will give you an
                                                    accurate total wattage:

                                                    Volts x Amps = watts

                                                    So, to determine the power that your solar panel is generating, you
                                                    will need to first measure the amperage and voltage.</p>

                                                <h3 class="col-md-12">Start by Noting the Power Rating:</h3>
                                                <p class="p-design m-t20 col-md-12">One of the first things you will
                                                    want to take note of is the actual power rating of your solar
                                                    panels. As discussed above, this wattage rating will not necessarily
                                                    reflect the amount of electricity your solar panels can generate, as
                                                    plenty of variables can influence performance, but it is still
                                                    useful information to have, as it will give you an idea of how well
                                                    your solar panels are performing in relation to their maximum
                                                    potential.</p>
                                                <p class="p-design m-t20 col-md-12">When solar panels are given a
                                                    power rating, the number is based off a laboratory test, where the
                                                    solar panel is exposed to an hour of simulated sunlight that
                                                    measures 1,000 watts per square meter. During these tests, the solar
                                                    panels are also kept at a constant temperature of 77 F, as
                                                    temperature fluctuations can also impact performance./p>
                                                <p class="p-design m-t20 col-md-12">So, if a solar panel has a power
                                                    rating of 300W, that means it produced 300 watts of electricity
                                                    after being tested in ideal conditions. Again, if you were to
                                                    purchase this same 300W solar panel, it would likely produce less
                                                    power than this, which is why it is important to test its
                                                    performance for yourself.</p>

                                                    These are fairly affordable devices and they can be purchased at

                                                    getting an accurate reading, you will also need to use a variable
                                                    resistor box. These devices allow you to get readings at different

                                                    want to make a quick calculation to get the power output for your
                                                    solar panel. Simply use the amperage and voltage readings your
                                                    earlier tests revealed and perform the following equation: Volts x

                                                    wattage of your solar panels, you can multiply this number by the
                                                    average hours of sunlight you get per day:

                                                    total, as it helps account for the fact that the directness of the
                                                    sunlight will not be consistent throughout the day. Sunlight tends
