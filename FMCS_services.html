                    <h3>What is BIS Standard Mark?</h3>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">BIS Standard Mark is also
                        commonly known as ISI Mark; this Mark is specified by the Bureau
                        of Indian Standards. ISI Mark allows you to use the Standard
                        Mark (ISI Mark). This Mark ensures that the product has to abide
                        by the Indian Standards which are laid by the BIS. The Bureau of
                        Indian Standards is authorized to provide the ISI Mark through
                        proper evaluation, examination, documentation, etc. This process
                        authorizes that a Manufacturer has been following standards &
                        guideline set by the BIS.</p>
                    <h3>Significance of FMCS BIS Certification in
                        India</h3>
                    <p class="p-design m-t20 text-justify">It is necessary to get FMCS
                        BIS Certification in India for mandatory products. Without this
                        Certification, the manufacturers are not able to sell their
                        products in the Indian Market. So, with this Certification you
                        can get easily access to Indian Market, avail legal benefits and
                        more. Obtaining FMCS BIS Certification is very tedious and
                        complex; our team of professionals can make this process very
                        easy as we are directly in connection with the BIS Officer for
                        proper follow-ups and acknowledgements.</p>
