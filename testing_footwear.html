                                                    designed to discharge static electricity from the wearer's body
                                                    through shoes into grounded floors. This kind of footwear is used in
                                                    workplaces where the risk of igniting volatile chemicals or
                                                    explosives is dramatically reduced. The conductivity test is carried
                                                    out by placing the footwear filled with small metal spheres on an
                                                    electrode plate.
                                                    A second electrode is placed among the spheres and a voltage is
                                                    applied for a specific time to measure the electrical resistance.
